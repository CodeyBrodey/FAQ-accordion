## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to make a function that checks first if the question accordion is open and, if so, for it to close it if clicked on again.

### Continued development

This was a great Javascript confidence booster for me and im definitely going to tackle some harder challenges with Javascript in the future.
